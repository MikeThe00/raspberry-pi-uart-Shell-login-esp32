Use a ESP32 to communicate with a Raspberry pi using uart
credits for the unmodified code (www.programmingboss.com) and here is the url Where I got the Unmodified code from (https://www.programmingboss.com/2021/04/esp32-arduino-serial-communication-with-code.html#gsc.tab=0)

Before you try this on any raspberry pi just know that currently right now I've only tested this out with a Raspberry pi 3 B+ 
Although I did follow wiring that was done on a Raspberry pi 4 B So if you follow all the steps you should be able to do it on both models although I'm not sure since I do not have a Raspberry pi 4 B
To include this code is kinda janky since it was originally meant to be used with a Arduino Uno
//               The steps to do this is coming soon                   //
